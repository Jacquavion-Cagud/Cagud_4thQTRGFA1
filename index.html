    <p id="Content">
        We are the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Our goal as a charity is to advocate for the protection of children's rights, to help meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential.
        A reason that you should support us is because we allocate the funds we recieve to the children in need of help from all over the world, so in a sense, your helping them with your kind donations.
        Not only do we support them financially, but we also support them through education, as we aim to give every child an education. 
        Lastly, UNICEF aims to fight against gender inequality, as we are currently arranging programs that shows the importances of both boys and girls.
